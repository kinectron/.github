# Kinectron

Kinectron is an Electron-based application that enables real-time streaming of Microsoft Azure Kinect data into web browsers using WebRTC. It provides a simple way for creative coders, interactive designers, and researchers to access depth-sensing data in web applications without the need for native code.

Kinectron Version 1 is now available with support for Azure Kinect only. Version 0, with support for Windows and Azure Kinect is no longer supported as of May 2025. Three-Kinectron and Aframe addons are not updated to work with Version 1.
